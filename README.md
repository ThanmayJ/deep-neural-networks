# deep-neural-networks

This repository contains implementations of various neural network architectures inspired by the lectures taught by Prof. Mitesh Khapra (IIT Madras CS6910). The goal of this project is to understand, implement, and train different types of neural networks using both NumPy and PyTorch.

## Contents

- **Feedforward Classifier**: Implementation of a simple feedforward neural network using NumPy.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: CNNs implemented using PyTorch for image classification tasks.
- **Sequence Modelling**: Sequence modelling neural networks using PyTorch for tasks like language modeling and time series prediction.

Each directory contains a detailed README with instructions on how to set up and run the models.
